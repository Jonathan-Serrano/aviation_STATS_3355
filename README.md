# STAT 3355 Group Team 5 Project

## Background and Motivation
This dataset includes all domestic non-stop flights from 1987 to the present. We narrowed down the data to a subset containing only flights arriving in or departing from Texas during June or July of the years 2018-2022. We choose these years because they will give us a good idea of what data was like for before covid and during/after covid. We choose to narrow down the data from the whole USA to Texas because otherwise the dataset would be very large, containing well over a million observations. We choose July and June because it might be more interesting to look at data for summer months, when people are flying for vacations more. 

We chose this dataset because it was the most interesting to us. We chose this because of recent events that have caused more delays and cancellations in flights such as COVID-19. We wanted to explore the effect that this had on airlines and flights. We are also interested in seeing how the recent surge in demand for traveling has affected the airlines. Other more frequent occurrences like severe weather affect flight times so we are curious to be able to find  patterns to determine if there is a certain time period or season that causes flights to be delayed or more in demand. We also are curious to find the reason for these delays. After assessing the datasets, we hope to be able to find trends in airline delays.
