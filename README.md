## Dataset Used
Airline On-Time Performance Data: Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance (1987- present): https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ&QO_fu146_anzr=b0-gvzr

## Datset Information
Our dataset contains observations about all domestic non-stop flights from 1987 to the present. However, our group is looking at flights that land or take off in Texas during the months of June and July in the past 5 years. Given the demand for flying and visiting new locations the existence of this dataset is interesting to look at. Our dataset includes 100,000 observations and approximately 45 variables.

## Background and Motivation
This dataset includes all domestic non-stop flights from 1987 to the present. We narrowed down the data to a subset containing only flights arriving in or departing from Texas during June or July of the years 2018-2022. We choose these years because they will give us a good idea of what data was like for before covid and during/after covid. We choose to narrow down the data from the whole USA to Texas because otherwise the dataset would be very large, containing well over a million observations. We choose July and June because it might be more interesting to look at data for summer months, when people are flying for vacations more. 

We chose this dataset because it was the most interesting to us. We chose this because of recent events that have caused more delays and cancellations in flights such as COVID-19. We wanted to explore the effect that this had on airlines and flights. We are also interested in seeing how the recent surge in demand for traveling has affected the airlines. Other more frequent occurrences like severe weather affect flight times so we are curious to be able to find patterns to determine if there is a certain time period or season that causes flights to be delayed or more in demand. We also are curious to find the reason for these delays.
